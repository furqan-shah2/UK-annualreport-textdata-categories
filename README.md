# UK-annualreport-textdata-categories

The `data files` folder contains 23 UK Firms' Annual Report Text classified in following categories: Financial, Human, Natural, Social & Relationship, Manufactured, Intellectual and Unclassified. These categories are based on Integrated Reporting Framework's six capitals, broadly defined as follows:

- **Financial**: *Information about the company’s financial performance,
  including revenue, expenses, profits, and financial health.*
- **Human**: *Relates to employees, their well-being, skills, and
  workforce management.*
- **Intellectual**: *Covers intangible assets like patents, trademarks,
  and the company’s innovation capacity.*
- **Natural**: *Focuses on environmental sustainability, resource usage,
  and the company’s ecological impact.*
- **Social & Relationship**: *Refers to the company’s interactions with
  stakeholders, including communities, customers, and regulators.*
- **Manufactured**: *Involves physical assets such as infrastructure,
  equipment, and operational capacity.*
- **Unclassified**: *Includes disclosures that do not fit into the other
  categories.*

I used this data to train and implement a text classification model as part of my PhD thesis. I also incorporated this data in coding tutorials available (and upcoming projects) on my GitHub repositories for demonstration purposes.
